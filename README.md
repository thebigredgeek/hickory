Hickory VM
==========

#### Building

To build the VM:

    $ make


#### Running the sample program

The sample program takes two inputs, adds them together, and displays the output.  It is located in `programs/add.ssc`.

To run it:

    $ make test

#### Documentation

#### Roadmap

I'll be adding more instructions, bound to various libraries, over time.  I also plan on building a compiler and companion lanuage and switching to binary storage instead of ascii characters for compiled content.  For now, all programming is done on the bare-metal level with decimal numbers.

Enjoy!
